# Analysis

* If: High correlation - Low MSE - Low DTW → Experiments are strongly similar. They behave almost the same in both shape and size.
* If: High correlation - High MSE → Same pattern, different magnitude. They rise and fall the same way, but one is much bigger or smaller than the other.
* If: Low correlation - Low DTW → Possibly time-shifted but similar structure. They follow a similar pattern, but one happens slightly earlier or later in time.
